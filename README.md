# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Codmetric**.

## 📌 Objective
To analyze and model passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building & evaluation
- Visualization of survival trends

## 📈 Results
- Achieved >78% accuracy with Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Found that gender, class, and age significantly influenced survival.
